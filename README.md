# Term 1 terminal app project

## Brainstorming session
Potential idea #1 - Vanessa suggested app that would pull weather data using API's and popular travel locations and based on weather data during the time of year that you would like to go would recommend possible locations based on historical weather data that would make your holiday more enjoyable! :)

Potential idea #2 - An app that scrapes the web and pulls inspirational quotes, presenting them to the user who could filter by category!

Potential idea #3 - An app that measures reaction time and gives a rating on your reflexes.

Potential idea #4 - An app that helps the user make a budget, based on negotiable and non-negotiable budget items and incentivises savings goals with a time reward based on improvements in spending.

Potential idea #5 - An app that takes information about your vehicle use, fuel consumption, distance travelled and tells you how efficient your vehicle is, how much it costs to run, how much you need to budget to run it and can tell you how expensive a potential trip would be.

We discussed these idea, the complexity of each one, what we were both interested in and what suited our respective strengths, and thus chose option #4!


## Planning Stage

In discussing the budget app Laurence liked the idea of thinking about things that are non-negotiable and things that could be left out or made cheaper. Vanessa introduced the idea of incentivising the user to make improvements to their expenditure by using a carrot instead of a stick, advising the user that based on improvements would be able to meet their goal in a quicker period of time. We felt that this is a good combination as it takes in simple variables, presents simple results and combines non-judgemental ease of use and encourages people to take control of their finances!

Started by setting up our git hub repository, decided to call our app 'lnvproject' fo the timebeing.

SPECS - 

1. Inputs
- Non-negotiable expenses

-- SUPER STRETCH - Based on user estimate of current time it will take them to reach goal
- Connect to API's to help user find cheaper alternatives to 'making life not suck' expenses

4. Gems to use
- Terminal table for outputing budget details
- TTY gems for file handling more pleasing outputs (better user interface)
